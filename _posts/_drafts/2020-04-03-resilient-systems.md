description: Considerations of how the Systems Thinking characteristic of Resiliency maps to software systems

In Systems Thinking, one of the key characteristics of why systems are successful is **resilience**._"Resilience is a measure of a systemâ€™s ability to survive and persist within a variable environment" (Meadows, p76)_.

In the example of a basic system below, the resource stock could be any renewable resource such as trees or fish.  The stock flows out of the system via Harvesting and the stock is replenished through Regeneration.

The systems resilience is determined by the balancing feedback loop of the _regeneration rate_.  If the harvesting is too high, this will in turn impact the stock level.  A critically low resource stock level will impact the _regeneration rate_ and thus the systems resilience.

Overfishing is a typical example of a system losing it's resiliency.
