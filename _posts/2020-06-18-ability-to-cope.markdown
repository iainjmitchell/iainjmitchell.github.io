description: An examination of Causal Loop Diagrams through an example of Ability to Cope

This is my favourite diagram at the moment....

![Causal Loop Diagram of Ability to Cope](../images/ability-to-cope.jpg)

I've shared it with countless colleagues, as I feel it really demonstrates the vicious circle that many Software Teams/Departments find themselves in.  

It is shamelessly copied and adapted from an example in the book [Seeing the Forest For the Trees](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/811882.Seeing_the_Forest_for_the_Trees).  The example in the book is based upon a back-office function of a financial organisation, yet it shares many of the traits of departments and teams in Software.

This type of diagram is called a **Causal Loop Diagram** and is used to show the interactions between parts of a system.  Each link between elements is annotated with either an S or O.  These inform the reader whether the connected elements move in the same (S) or opposite (O) direction.  

What is the diagram above conveying to us?  If we start from _volume and variety of initiatives_, when this increases (as often happens in Software) the _workload_ moves in the same direction (S) - it also increases!  Consequently, an increase in _workload_ will cause a decrease in the _ability to cope_, as this moves in the opposite direction (O). 

As a result of this the _incidence of error_ will increase, as this moves in the opposite direction of _ability to cope_.  The increased number of errors will cause the _strain in management_ to move in the same direction (increase).  Finally, this strain will cause the same direction movement in the _workload_, thus increasing this further.  Which completes this **vicious circle** that if left unchecked will continue to deteriorate.

There is also an additional information about how staff levels, cost and delays impact this loop externally.  Furthermore, it also shows how _service quality_ is impacted by this **vicious circle**.

The loop that is causing the vicious circle is an example of a **reinforcement loop**.  These types of loop will continue to spin until some action is taken, in this example the influencing factor is the _volume and variety of initiatives_.  

All reinforcement loops can create **vicious** or **virtuous** circles, it depends on the influencing factor(s).  In our example above, if the _volume and variety of initiatives_ is at a more manageable level it will decrease the _workload_.  This in turn will increase the _ability to cope_, which will reduce the _incidence of errors_.  For this reason the _strain on management_ will be reduced which then leads to a reduction in _workload_.  We now have a **virtuous** circle!

Hence, this **causal loop diagram** illustrates that the flow of work into teams is the most important lever to control both the ability of team members to cope and the sustainability of delivery.  This is probably not a surprise to many software teams, but this diagram and **causal loop diagrams** in general are a great way of illustrating systemic traps that organisations get themselves into.
