description: My law of Job Title Diffusion in a causal loop diagram with intervention!
---

In my [previous post](/blog/law-of-job-title-diffusion) I covered the phenomenon of **Job Title Diffusion**.  That is the impact of a variety of job titles can have on a organisation.

Recently, I've had to examine this in more detail and found that a **Causal Loop Diagram** really helped to illustrate and understand the problem (see [this post](/blog/ability-to-cope) for more details about Causal Loop Diagrams).  What I ended up with is the diagram below.

As a refresher, the **S** links move in the **Same** direction and the **O** links move in the **Opposite** direction.  For example, as the `variety of job roles` increase in a team also the `variety of technology and code` increases in the team (S link).  Also, as the `variety of job roles` increases the `variety of work an individual can pick up` decreases (O link).

There is a **Reinforcement Loop** going from `variety of job roles` to `variety of work an individual can pick up` to `pressure to recruit specialists` and back to `variety of job roles`.  This often manifests itself in a **vicious circle** that drives the number of each type of specialist which reinforces the siloing of job role and `variety of technology and code` in the team.  

I've also recorded that having more individuals who can only pick up certain types of work can cause `pressure for more work in-progress` which will negatively impact the `amount of work delivered` (work takes longer to complete and is impacted by workers being unavailable).  This in turn creates `pressure to recruit more specialists` and fuels our **Reinforcement Loop**.

There are two output _dangles_ from the system.  The first of these is the `bus factor risk` of the team, this is a rather macabre idea of how much the team would be impacted by an individual being hit by a bus (a bus factor of 1 would be only one person knows about this part of the system).  Second, is the `pressure on team cost` which is driven by the `pressure on small team size`, which in turn is driven by `variety of job roles in the team`.

Finally, I've added the intervention I suggested in my previous post as an input _dangle_.  This is highlighted in yellow and named `encourage people to work outside their specialism`.  This impacts the `variety of work that an individual can pick up` and starts to turn the **Reinforcement Loop** into a **virtuous**, rather than **vicious**, circle.
