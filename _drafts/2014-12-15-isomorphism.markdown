Recently I've been reading a fascinating book by Douglas Hofstadter called [GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach).  In an early chapter he introduces the concept of *Formal Systems*, which is any system of abstract thought based upon the model of mathematics. 

Further into the book a Formal System called the PQ-system is proposed.

> **DEFINITION:** 
> *x*P-Q*x*- is an [axiom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom), whenever *x* is composed of hyphens only.

> **RULE OF PRODUCTION:**
> Suppose *x*, *y* and *z* all stand for particular strings containing only hyphens.  
> And suppose that *x*P*y*Q*z* is known to be a theorem.  
> Then *x*P*y*-Q*z*- is a theorem.

The author then asks the reader to discover the [decision proceduree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem) of the formal system, which is revealed to be that the first two hypen groups should add up, in length, to the third hypen group.

So [theorems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem) would include:

```
--P---Q-----

-P--Q---

-P---Q----
```

And would not include:

```
--P--Q-

-P-Q---
```

You may have noticed that effectively this formal system is about adding two numbers together, the - represents a count and the number of these either side of the P add up to the number after the Q.  So, the theorem --P---Q----- is equivalent to 2 + 3 = 5.

This leads us to an interesting discovery, does the symbol P actual mean 'Plus' and the symbol Q mean 'eQuals'?  This is an example of isomorphism, we are attaching a real world meaning to a symbol in a Formal System.  

But are our isomorphic assumptions correct?  Does it influence our discovery of the Decision Procedure and thus the entire Formal System?

Programming languages are a form of Formal Systems, so it's unsurprising that this same problem plays out in the code we write.
