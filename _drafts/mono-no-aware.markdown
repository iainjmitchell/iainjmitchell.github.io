description: Software through 'mono no aware'
---

The [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-aesthetics/) defines **mono no aware** as
> a “pathos” (aware) of “things” (mono), deriving from their transience

The term was constructed by [Motoori Norinaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoori_Norinaga) in the eighteenth century to encapsulate the mood which was central to the Japanese.  This was particularly focussed upon the impermanence of things and a slightly melancholy awareness of this.  But there is also a quiet rejoicing as our awareness allows us the opportunity to witness the beauty in these things.

The annual Sakura (Cherry blossom) in Japan is a good example of mono no aware.  Every year thousands of Japanese families visit parks to witness and celebrate the mere days of Sakora.  Before it falls from the trees and is no more.  I recommend the excellent book [Hokkaido Highway Blues](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hokkaido-Highway-Blues-Hitchhiking-Japan/dp/1841952885) to learn more about this part of Japanese culture.

So why am I writing about **mono no aware** in my software blog?

After reading about this term I looked at my day-to-day life through the lenses of **mono no aware** and realised that it could be applied to software engineering.
